Angular2 + Store Integration

---

A simple Store integration on Angular2 DI. This Store shares "data(states)" and "data(states)-history" between routing pages.

You can get data(states) from Store as non-Observable values, Observables or Stream Observables. 

Due to Store's Push behavior, it allows Angular2 OnPush-ChangeDetection-Strategy that makes your apps very fast. 

### Setup
```
npm install
```

### Run
```
npm start
```
